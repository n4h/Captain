# Captain chess engine

Captain is a UCI compliant chess engine written in C++. It can work with any chess GUI that supports UCI, although it has only been tested with the [Banksia chess GUI](https://banksiagui.com/).

I have learned a lot from studying other chess engines and projects, including:

* [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
* [Arasan](https://github.com/jdart1/arasan-chess)
* [Nemorino](https://bitbucket.org/christian_g_nther/nemorino/src/master/)
* [Gigantua](https://github.com/Gigantua/Gigantua)
* [The chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page)
